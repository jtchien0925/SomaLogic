README for the R SomaDataIO package 

This document accompanies the R package SomaDataIO, which loads the SomaSciences proprietary data file, the ADAT file. The package provides auxiliary functions for extracting relevant information from the adat object once in the R environment. Basic familiarity with the R environment, and with installation of contributed packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), is assumed.

To install SomaDataIO:

1. Download the file SomaDataIO_<version>.tar.gz.

2. Ensure that the following package dependencies are installed, from the R console:
   install.package(c("digest","reshape"))

3. Install SomaDataIO (from the R Console):
   install.packages("SomaDataIO_<version>.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")

4. NOTE: The Biobase and reshape packages are *suggested* packages, each being required by only one function. Biobase must be installed separately from Bioconductor (from the R console):
   source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
   biocLite("Biobase")

Information about Bioconductor can be found here:
   http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html

5. Upon successful installation, type library(SomaDataIO) in the R Console to load the package, then type library(help=SomaDataIO) for an index of commands.
